Seattle should roll up good \r\nnumbers against the Denver defense, which has underachieved for most of the \r\nyear.   \r\n\r\n Sean Dawkins , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Dawkins has been inconsistent all year long. But the Broncos' pass defense \r\nis one of the most vulnerable units in football, and the Seattle WR has a \r\nchance to shine this week.   \r\n\r\n Seahawks , DT SEA - Baja Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Avoid Seattle's defense at all costs this week. Last time the Seahawks faced \r\nDenver, Mike Anderson rushed for nearly 200 yards and WR Rod Smith \r\nembarrassed them with 78 rushing yards on just three carries.  \r\n\r\n John Carney , K SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Carney won't be much of a factor this week. San Diego will have a very hard \r\ntime moving the ball into Baltimore's end of the field.  \r\n\r\n Freddie Jones , TE SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Jones might have a quiet outing this week. Baltimore is very aware he is San \r\nDiego's top offensive option and will look to shut him down quickly.  \r\n\r\n Terrell Fletcher , RB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Don't expect much from Fletcher this week. The true strength of Baltimore's \r\ndefense is its ability to squash the run. The Ravens have shut down much more \r\ndecorated backs all season long.   \r\n\r\n Ryan Leaf , QB SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n After an interception-filled performance last week, Leaf is in for more \r\nproblems on Sunday. The Ravens' stellar defense will surely knock him around \r\nall day and Leaf will surely make some frustrating turnovers. Under no \r\ncirumstances should you start him.    \r\n\r\n Chargers , DT SD - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n The Chargers might be able to contain RB Jamal Lewis this week, but the \r\noverworked and undermanned secondary will be torn apart by Trent Dilfer and \r\nspeedsters such as Qadry Ismail and Pat Johnson.   \r\n\r\n Raiders , DT OAK - Matt Lenhart Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Don't expect a solid performance from the Raiders' defense this week. \r\nCharles Woodson will have trouble with Wayne Chrebet, and Curtis Martin might \r\nbe able to outrun the LBs on pitches and sweeps.  \r\n\r\n Andre Rison , WR OAK - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 \r\n The inconsistent Rison might show off his best form this week. He will be \r\ntoo much for the Jets to handle on passing downs and should be a key \r\nthird-down target.  \r\n\r\n Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 \r\n The erratic Janikoswki will get a good amount of chances to kick this week. \r\nThe Raiders will move the ball in the air but might sputter against the Jets \r\nin the red zone.   \r\n\r\n Tim Brown , WR OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Expect a big game from Brown this week. Jets CB Aaron Glenn might draw him \r\nin coverage, and will not be able to handle him on crossing routes.  \r\n\r\n Zack Crockett , RB OAK - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Crockett should continue to be a factor in Oakland's offense this week. \r\nTyrone Wheatley is battling finger and ankle problems and the Raiders may \r\nneed to use Crockett often against the Jets.   \r\n\r\n Rich Gannon , QB OAK - McKay Neal Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Gannon might be Oakland's most productive player this week.",

Look for him to \r\npick apart the inconsistent Jets secondary, especially with passes to Tim \r\nBrown.   \r\n\r\n Broncos , DT DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Denver's defense has been ripped to shreds lately and will have a lot of \r\ntrouble handling Seattle's Ricky Watters this week. Watters totaled more than \r\n200 yards from scrimmage against Denver on Nov. 26.   \r\n\r\n Chiefs , DT KC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 12/08/00 \r\n The Kansas City defense has underperformed lately but might rebound against \r\nthe Panthers. Brad Hoover doesn't present much of a threat to the front seven \r\nand the Kansas City defensive line should be able to get good pressure on \r\nSteve Beuerlein.  \r\n\r\n Todd Peterson , K KC - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Peterson might have one of his better games of the year this week. The \r\nKansas City passing game will ensure that Peterson will see quite a few \r\nchances to kick against Carolina.  \r\n\r\n Tony Richardson , RB KC - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Richardson will regain the starting halfback job this week. He is an \r\naccomplished pass-catcher, but Richardson doesn't do much else and won't help \r\nmany Fantasy playoff teams advance to the next round.  \r\n\r\n Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - The Klap Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Another week, another big performance for Gonzalez. Look for the superstar \r\nTE to get in the end zone one or two times against the Panthers, who will not \r\nbe able to contain him over the middle.  \r\n\r\n Derrick S. Alexander , WR KC - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Alexander should post fine numbers against the Carolina secondary this week. \r\nCBs Eric Davis and Doug Evans will not be able to keep up with him on deep \r\nroutes.  \r\n\r\n Elvis Grbac , QB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Grbac is looking healthy again and should perform well against Carolina. He \r\nshould be a solid performer for the remainder of the Fantasy postseason.  \r\n\r\n Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Stewart completed a full practice Friday and reported no trouble with his \r\ninjured right leg. An MRI earlier in the week revealed no structural damage \r\nto Stewart's knee, coach Bill Cowher said. His injury is officially listed as \r\na strained upper calf. Stewart is still a risky start against a tough Giants \r\ndefense.  \r\n\r\n Jason Elam , K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Elam should see lots of scoring opportunities this week. The Broncos will \r\nhave no problem controlling the clock and scoreboard against Seattle.  \r\n\r\n Dwayne Carswell , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Carswell has become a reliable Fantasy tight end recently. He should perform \r\nwell against the Seahawks, who have always been vulnerable over the \r\nmiddle.     \r\n\r\n Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Top Dogs Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Frerotte is an excellent choice to start this week. He should put up good \r\nnumbers against Seattle, as long as he avoids CB Shawn Springs.   \r\n\r\n Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Rocks Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Watters missed Thursday's practice with a turf toe injury but is expected to \r\nplay Sunday. Last time he faced Denver on Nov. 26, he totaled 203 yards from \r\nscrimmage and scored a touchdown.  \r\n\r\n Jeff Graham , WR SD - Martin Cuilla Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Graham won't need dental surgery after taking a hard hit in the mouth last \r\nweek. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game and is an extremely \r\nrisky start, especially since San Diego faces the very tough Baltimore \r\ndefense.  \r\n\r\n Kimble Anders , RB KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Anders has lost the starting halfback job. Tony Richardson will reclaim that \r\nspot, with Donnell Bennett taking over at fullback. Frank Moreau will be used \r\nin short-yardage situations. Unless you're desperate, don't start any Kansas \r\nCity RBs.  \r\n\r\n Steve Christie , K BUF - Hunter Shively Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Christie was held without a point in last week's game against the Dolphins, \r\nbut don't expect the same this week against the Colts. Christie is a solid \r\nFantasy performer who will get his chances on Monday night in a game between \r\ntwo teams fighting to stay in the playoff hunt.  \r\n\r\n Sylvester Morris , WR KC - Eric Bass Updated 12/08/00 \r\n Morris, who appears to be an unreliable Fantasy starter right now, told the \r\nKansas City Star he might be wearing down after some early-season heroics. \"I \r\nmissed the majority of camp, so there's not that much wear and tear on me, \r\nbut it's still a long season,\" he said. \"It's not so bad physically.",
